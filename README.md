# ECG Classifier

Welcome to the **ECG Classifier** repository! ðŸš€

This project aims to provide a powerful, user-friendly, and efficient solution for classifying Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Using modern machine learning techniques and interactive Jupyter Notebooks, this repository is designed for researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts interested in biomedical signal processing and cardiac health.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Comprehensive Notebooks**: Step-by-step Jupyter Notebooks covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **State-of-the-art Algorithms**: Implements robust machine learning and deep learning models tailored for ECG data.
- **Easy to Use**: Modular code structure and clear documentation to help you get started quickly.
- **Extendable**: Easily adapt the pipeline for your own ECG datasets or other time-series classification tasks.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
